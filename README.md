# Design patterns for derivatives pricing in Python

A collection of Python code adapted from Mark Joshi's C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing (2nd edition).

I hope this resource will be useful for any aspiring practitioners in quantitative finance.

# Disclaimer

All credits to the origination of the code go to Mark Joshi. 

The exercise of rewriting this in Python 3.11 was also greatly assisted by [Ignacio Anguita's attempt](https://github.com/IgnacioAnguita/C-Design-Patterns-and-Derivatives-Pricing-recoded) in doing so when I'm stuck with unfamiliar C++/Python concepts.
